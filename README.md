# landing-page

<h1>6/24/2025</h1>
Starting Landing Page project, using HTML, CSS and Flexbox. Flexbox is the one thing I don't feel mildly well with so going to spend most of my time studying that and working on that, but I got this. ;>

Finished Landing page, Flexbox still is painful but I understand it better! I restarted like 20 times but its better than I knew before!
